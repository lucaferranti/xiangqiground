- Well typed with TypeScript

- Support for 3D pieces and boards
- Full mobile support (touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
- Move pieces by click
- Move pieces by drag & drop
  - Minimum distance before drag
  - Centralisation of the piece under the cursor
  - Piece ghost element
  - Drop off revert or trash
- Premove by click or drag
- Drag new pieces onto the board (editor, Crazyhouse)

## Acknowledgement

Xiangqiground is a fork of [chessground](https://github.com/lichess-org/chessground) adapted to xiangqi. This work would not have been possible without the amazing work from the lichess team.

The pieces design used in the demo is from wikimedia.
